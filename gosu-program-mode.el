;; A mode for interacting with gosu programs.
;;
;; This is not a mode for interacting with _inferior gosu processes_; rather, it
;; is a minor mode that enhances the shell with some additional commands I find
;; convenient. It allows you to easily restart the running program, clear the
;; shell or run tests; all this is abstracted into a system involving "profiles"
;; which just let you to control the commands used for both running the program
;; and running tests.
;;
;; The supplied example is for a gosu server that uses Aardvark to both run the
;; actual program ("vark server") and to run the tests ("vark test"); however, 
;; there is nothing binding this to Aardvark, or indeed to Gosu at all. However,
;; since I personally have only used this for Gosu so far,
